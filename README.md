## Insights

## Things to improve

If I had more time I would:

- Create a button to collapse the side bar and show entire map.
- Consume more APIs to show more data such as flights or weather.
- Change map styles to make UI more clean.
- Create custom hooks for cleaner code and reusability.
- Increase responsiveness with better CSS rules.
- Create UI for caught errors instead of just console logging them
